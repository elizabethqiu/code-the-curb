ðŸŒŸ From ["Parking Meter Rates History: DB"](https://gisdata-arlgis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/9bbfca97a814415db1b5e50695a2712c_2/explore)

It shows different parking meter configurations and rate changes across various locations in the county.

Looking at the columns:
- RateHistoryOID and par1MainGeneralOID appear to be unique identifiers for different parking meter locations/zones
- DaysoftheWeek shows when the rates are in effect (e.g., Monday-Friday, Monday-Saturday)
- EffectiveDate and RetiredDate show when rate changes begin and end
- StartTime and EndTime indicate the hours of operation for paid parking
- Hours shows how long you can park
- Rate shows the hourly parking rate (ranging from $1.50 to $2.75 per hour)
- The Inactive column (0 or 1) likely indicates whether that particular rate configuration is currently active

For example, one entry shows a rate of $2.75/hour, effective from September 23, 2024, applying Monday-Friday from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM with a 2-hour maximum parking duration.

This database helps track how parking rates and regulations have changed over time throughout Arlington County, which is important for both parking management and public transparency. The data is regularly updated, with the most recent updates shown as of November 12, 2024.
